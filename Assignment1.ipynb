    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Input Tests\n",
    "The first part of the code tests for correct shape of the inputs, Given an input is incorrect, we try to reshape the state from a list of lists to an array. Next we check if the input has any duplicates in it as we know there aren't any duplicates in the 8-puzzle. Once all these tests are passed, we flatten & sort the input & compare it to the goal state (for the initial test). If either of the tests fail, the input is marked as incorrect.\n",
    "        \n",
    "##### Search Algorithm\n",
    "The second part of the code first does a set up for the upcoming search algorithm. We first set the initial node to the start state, then initiate the cost dictionary for tracking search cost which enables the algorithm as a whole to have a O(n) runtime, and a O(1) lookup time for each instance of checking if a child node has been previously initialized and stored in costs. Then we generate the frontier and count the maximum fronties size after every step. After this initial setup is done, the code then generates possible future moves and appends them to the frontier until a solution is found while the cost dictionary keeps track of previously explored states.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Optimal Path \n",
    "The last part of the code reconstructs the path of the optimal solution and returns summary statistics of the algorithm to evaluate performance."
